# Llama Stack test fixtures (internal)

These files are for **internal Open Data Hub / OpenShift AI integration tests** only. We use them to hit **[Llama Stack](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack) vector store APIs**---think ingest, indexing, search, and the plumbing around that---not as a shipped dataset or for model training.

## Folder layout

```text

  corpus/
    <subject>/                    # one folder per subject (e.g. "finance")
      *.pdf                       # source documents
      documents.json              # manifest: per-file metadata & attributes
    pdf-testing/                  # special: edge-case PDFs (encrypted, signed, etc.)
  ground_truth/
    <subject>_qa.jsonl            # QA pairs for the corresponding subject
```

### Current contents

| Path | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `corpus/finance/` | IBM quarterly earnings press releases (Q1–Q4 2025, 4 PDFs) |
| `corpus/finance/documents.json` | Manifest with per-file attributes (entity, period, doc type, etc.) |
| `corpus/pdf-testing/` | Edge-case PDFs: password-encrypted, PAdES-signed |
| `ground_truth/finance_qa.jsonl` | 60 QA pairs across 4 IBM quarters, 3 retrieval modes each |

## Using `datasets.py`

The module `tests/llama_stack/datasets.py` provides a lightweight, dependency-free loader for the files in this directory. It exposes typed dataclasses and pre-built `Dataset` instances that tests and fixtures can import directly.

### Core types

| Class | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `DatasetDocument` | A single document: resolved `path`, `document_id`, and optional `attributes` dict |
| `DatasetDocumentQA` | A single QA record: `id`, `question`, `ground_truth`, `retrieval_mode`, `document_id` |
| `Dataset` | Groups a `qa_path` and a tuple of `DatasetDocument`s; provides `load_qa()` |

### Pre-built dataset instances

| Instance | Documents | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `FINANCE_DATASET` | All 4 IBM quarterly PDFs | Full corpus; documents loaded from `corpus/finance/documents.json` |
| `IBM_2025_Q4_EARNINGS` | 1 (Q4 unencrypted) | Single-document subset for fast smoke tests |
| `IBM_2025_Q4_EARNINGS_ENCRYPTED` | 1 (Q4 encrypted) | Same content as Q4 but password-encrypted; for ingestion edge-case tests |

Subsets like `IBM_2025_Q4_EARNINGS` share the same `finance_qa.jsonl` as their `qa_path`. The `load_qa()` method automatically restricts returned QA records to the `document_id`s present in the subset's `documents`, so only relevant questions are returned.

### Loading QA records

```python
from tests.llama_stack.datasets import FINANCE_DATASET, IBM_2025_Q4_EARNINGS

# All QA records for the full corpus (60 records)
all_qa = FINANCE_DATASET.load_qa()

# Only "hybrid" retrieval-mode records
hybrid_qa = FINANCE_DATASET.load_qa(retrieval_mode="hybrid")

# QA records for a single-document subset (only Q4 questions)
q4_qa = IBM_2025_Q4_EARNINGS.load_qa()

# Combine filters: hybrid mode + specific document
q4_hybrid = IBM_2025_Q4_EARNINGS.load_qa(retrieval_mode="hybrid")
```

### Accessing documents and attributes

```python
from tests.llama_stack.datasets import FINANCE_DATASET

for doc in FINANCE_DATASET.documents:
    print(doc.path)          # "tests/llama_stack/dataset/corpus/finance/ibm-1q25-..."
    print(doc.document_id)   # "ibm_1q25_earnings_pr"
    print(doc.attributes)    # {"entity_symbol": "IBM", "period_year": 2025, ...}
```

### Using datasets in test parametrization

Tests receive a `Dataset` via indirect parametrize and a `dataset` fixture:

```python
from tests.llama_stack.datasets import FINANCE_DATASET, IBM_2025_Q4_EARNINGS, Dataset

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "vector_store, dataset",
    [
        pytest.param(
            {"vector_io_provider": "milvus", "dataset": IBM_2025_Q4_EARNINGS},
            IBM_2025_Q4_EARNINGS,
            id="milvus-single-doc",
        ),
        pytest.param(
            {"vector_io_provider": "faiss", "dataset": FINANCE_DATASET},
            FINANCE_DATASET,
            id="faiss-full-corpus",
        ),
    ],
    indirect=True,
)
class TestExample:
    def test_search(self, vector_store, dataset: Dataset) -> None:
        """Given: A populated vector store.
        When: QA queries are executed.
        Then: Results are returned for each retrieval mode.
        """
        for record in dataset.load_qa():
            # record.question, record.ground_truth, record.retrieval_mode
            ...
```

The `vector_store` fixture reads the `"dataset"` key from its param to upload the right documents; the `dataset` fixture hands the same `Dataset` instance to the test body for QA queries.

## Adding a new subject

1. Create `corpus/<subject>/` and drop in the source documents (PDFs, or any other format supported by the Llama Stack Files and Vector IO providers).
2. Then add the following files and configuration for the subject:
   - `corpus/<subject>/documents.json` — manifest mapping each file to a `document_id` and attributes (see schema below).
   - `ground_truth/<subject>_qa.jsonl` — QA pairs linking questions and answers to document IDs (see schema below).
   - A new `Dataset` instance in `tests/llama_stack/datasets.py` following the `FINANCE_DATASET` pattern.

## `documents.json` manifest

A JSON array where each entry maps a corpus file to uploadable attributes:

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "report-q1.pdf",
    "document_id": "report_q1",
    "attributes": {
      "entity_symbol": "ACME",
      "period_label": "2025-Q1",
      "period_year": 2025,
      "document_type": "earnings_press_release",
      "language": "en",
      "publication_date": 1745366400
    }
  }
]
```

- `filename`: file in the same directory as the manifest.
- `document_id`: stable identifier used to link QA records to their source.
- `attributes`: key-value pairs set on the vector-store file after upload (used for attribute filtering in search).

## `<subject>_qa.jsonl` schema

One JSON object per line:

```json
{
  "id": "acme-q1-hybrid-001",
  "question": "What was ACME's Q1 revenue?",
  "ground_truth": "Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion.",
  "retrieval_mode": "hybrid",
  "document_id": "report_q1"
}
```

- `id`: unique record identifier (`<entity>-<period>-<mode>-<seq>`).
- `question`: the query posed to the RAG system.
- `ground_truth`: reference answer (RAGAS convention for the expected answer).
- `retrieval_mode`: one of `vector`, `keyword`, or `hybrid`.
- `document_id`: links to `document_id` in `documents.json` for the source document.

## IBM finance PDFs (`corpus/finance/`)

The PDFs here are IBM **quarterly earnings press releases** (the same material IBM posts for investors). If you need to replace or refresh them, download the official PDFs from IBM's site:

[Quarterly earnings announcements](https://www.ibm.com/investor/financial-reporting/quarterly-earnings) (choose year and quarter, then open the press release PDF).

## PDF edge cases (`corpus/pdf-testing/`)

This folder is for **weird PDFs on purpose**: password-protected files, digitally signed ones (e.g. PAdES), and similar cases so we can test how ingestion and parsers behave when the file is not a plain "print to PDF" document.

## Small print

Not for external distribution as a "dataset." PDFs stay under their publishers' terms; don't reuse them outside this test context without checking those terms.
