"""
OVMS smoke test: run smoke scripts inside OpenShift using the OVMS runtime image.

How the Pod works:
  - A Pod is created in the test namespace with restart_policy=Never.
  - The smoke scripts (ovms_smoketest.py, smoke.py) are mounted read-only at /scripts
    via a ConfigMap populated from the repo files.
  - The container runs: python /scripts/ovms_smoketest.py && python /scripts/smoke.py.
  - If both scripts exit 0, the Pod phase becomes Succeeded.
  - If either script fails (non-zero exit or exception), the Pod fails and the test fails.
  - The test asserts Pod phase Succeeded; logs available via oc logs for debugging.

Note:
  This test requires internet access to download models from Hugging Face (e.g., "gpt2").
  It will fail in disconnected/air-gapped environments where external model downloads are not available.
